This is a project to analyze pizza sales. Through this initiative, we aim to address the following business problems:

1. What days and times is the restaurant the busiest?
2. How many pizzas are made during peak hours?
3. What are the restaurant's best-selling and worst-selling pizzas?
4. Who are the most recurring customers, and who are the least recurring?

This is a beginner-level project, and it's my first time working on an SQL and TABLEAU project. I hope this project proves helpful. I plan to develop higher-quality projects in the future.

Thank you.
